      added a description with a supplemental picture of a Warlock in destiny 2. the paragraph contains
      information that is both related to the game and some external things that are known quite well
      by the Destiny community at large. The information isnt generally that useful, but it can be
      an interesting thing to read/think about.

    <p>
      In my opinion, the best class in the game are Warlocks. (see picture above) <br>
      They offer a wide range of different builds that can be tailored into certain aspects <br>
      of the game. Currently my favorite build is an arc build that focuses heavily on melee <br>
      and ability regeneration. When done right, it allows for near constant melee ability <br>
      uptime. <br><br>
      When compared to the other two classes in the game, Warlocks are considered to be the <br>
      ones treated more favorably by the developers. A couple years ago, DeeJ, one of the <br>
      community managers at the time at Bungie, was known for his bias toward Warlocks. <br>
      At almost every reveal event or livestream bungie would put on, he was always donning <br>
      his Dead Orbit (this is one of the 3 main factions within the game) geared Warlock. <br>
      Sadly, he left bungie to pursue a new career at another game studio. <br><br>

        The following block is where i have my links to various websites. one is the main webpage
        of the Destiny 2 developers; Bungie. this is where you can learn more about the different
        aspects of the game as well as some story elements thatmay help you understand the game
        a little better. the others are a resource for Destiny 2 and the IGN link is to their
        main page where they have some reviews for recent games amongst other things.

        Here are some interesting websites that I like to visit.
        Most of them are gaming related and more than likely will be Destiny related.
